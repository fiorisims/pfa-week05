"""Run ExtendScript (JSX) inside the live Adobe Photoshop session over COM.

Usage:
    python photoshop_bridge.py script.jsx          run a file in Photoshop
    python photoshop_bridge.py -c "$.writeln(1)"   run inline JSX
    python photoshop_bridge.py --ping              check the bridge responds
    python photoshop_bridge.py --debug script.jsx  open the PS debugger on error

In PowerShell, inline code must go through the stop-parsing symbol
(`python photoshop_bridge.py --% -c "$.writeln(1)"`), because PS 5.1 strips the
double quotes inside a single-quoted argument; file mode needs no tricks.

Photoshop has no script port like Maya's command port; the bridge talks to the
Photoshop scripting engine directly and launches Photoshop if it is not running.
On Windows it uses COM (`Photoshop.Application` -> `DoJavaScript`); on macOS it
drives ExtendScript through AppleScript (`osascript` + `do javascript`), so no
extra tools are needed. (Linux has no Photoshop, so only file mode is usable.)
Output (from `$.writeln(...)`), errors and the value of a `__result__` variable
come back in _ps_out.txt.

Inside a script, use the Photoshop DOM (`app`, `Document`, `Layer`, ...) and end
with `__result__ = <value>` to send a value back. `#target` / `#include`
directives are not supported (the source is eval'd).
